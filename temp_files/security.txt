Session Based with Spring Security

vs

Token Based using JWT



Use Session-Based Authentication if:

    You're building a traditional web app with server-rendered pages (Thymeleaf, JSP).
    You want to manage user sessions and don't need to worry about scaling across multiple services.

Use JWT Authentication if:

    You're building a REST API for a frontend (React, Angular, etc.).
    You need a stateless authentication system (easier to scale).
